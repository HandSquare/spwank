# [spwank]

A text-based adventure game that (optionally) interacts with our Slack workspace and our bot, Jeremy.
Written in Python 3.8.2, node.js, and perhaps later Rust if @Gio or @Cleb wants to contribute.

## How to play

Make sure you have `python` 3.7 or higher installed.

```sh
git clone https://github.com/jonkislin/spwank
cd spwank
python play.py
```

## Some features (WIP)

1. Fancy menus  
2. Easter eggs
3. Cosmic/cyber horror
4. Fantasy series references (don't sue me, Tor)
5. Pythonic fun
6. Calls to [jeremy](https://github.com/nickells/jeremy-the-bot)!

In development. Pull requests welcome.
